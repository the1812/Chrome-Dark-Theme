# Chrome Dark Theme

Simple dark theme for Google Chrome.

> **The offcial dark theme is available in [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-black/aghfnjkcakhmadgdomlmlhhaocbkloab) now.**

> ⚠ Dark themes may not work properly in Chrome 73.

> Themes couldn't affect Omnibox (address bar). Thus it's recommended to turn on the Dark Mode of your system as well in order to make Chrome use dark theme for Omnibox.
